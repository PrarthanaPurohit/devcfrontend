## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **Socket.io Client** - Real-time communication
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **DaisyUI** - Tailwind CSS component library

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running on `http://localhost:3000` (for local development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd devcfrontend
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure Environment
   
   The application is configured to automatically switch between localhost and production backends.
   
   - **Local Development**: Points to `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Production**: Points to `https://devconnectbackend-aryy.onrender.com`

   See `src/utils/constants.js` and `src/utils/socket.js` for configuration details.

## Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts the development server at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates an optimized production build in the `dist` folder

### Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint to check code quality

### Preview
```bash
npm run preview
```
Preview the production build locally

## Deployment

### Vercel

The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration file to handle client-side routing on Vercel.

1. Install Vercel CLI or connect your repository to Vercel dashboard.
2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

The `vercel.json` ensures all requests are rewritten to `index.html` so React Router can handle the paths.

## Routes

- `/` - Feed page
- `/login` - Login/Signup page
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/connections` - View connections
- `/requests` - Manage connection requests
- `/premium` - Premium features
- `/chat/:targetUserId` - 1-on-1 Chat interface

## API Integration

The app communicates with a backend API. Key endpoints used:

- `POST /login` - User login
- `POST /signup` - User registration
- Additional endpoints for feed, connections, and requests

All API calls include credentials for cookie-based authentication.

## State Management

Redux Toolkit is used for global state management with the following slices:

- **user** - Current user data
- **feed** - User feed data
- **connections** - User connections
- **requests** - Connection requests
